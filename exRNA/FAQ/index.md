# FAQ for exRNA

## exRNA: extra-cellular RNA

#### How many types of exRNAs?

**exRNA** (extra-cellular RNA) includes long and short RNAs, which can be derived from the whole plamsa/serum (called cell -free RNA, **cf-RNA**), or enriched from the exosomes/EVs of plasma/serum (called **exoRNA**).

* long RNA: mRNA, lncRNA
* small RNA: miRNA, piRNA, siRNA
* ohter RNA: rRNA, tRNA, Y RNA, snRNA, snoRNA, srp RNA, etc
