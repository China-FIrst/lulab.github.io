# Checking List for Manuscript Writing

**Format**

1. Check Font: Time New Roman, 11pt or 10.5pt
2. Check Line: double space (except for References)

**Introduction**

- Background - Result - Conclusion

**Keywords** 

- Replace with key words you want to be searched. If number of key words is limited, may not repeat with title only if it is very important.

**Terms**

1. Check the writing of specific terms in the whole paper:
  - noncoding, cross-validation, *P*-value, V.S. (need to be capitalized), HCC/liver cancer
2. Check **Abreviations**: needs to be consistent in the whole paper. Check if using full name when first time mentioned (sometimes use full time several times in the beginning of Introduction, Methods, Suppl. Info. because they are usually separated documents.)

**Grammar**

1. Check plural or single
2. Check if Past tense used in general when describing results (e.g., "We sequenced 50 samples ...").
3. Check if Present tense when making some claim or conclusion (e.g., usually in the last sentence of a paragraph: "This result suggests that …" ).

**Figure and Figure Legend**

\> Figure and Figure legend sometimes are more IMPORTANT than main text.

1. Check if Figure Legends contain sufficiently detailed descriptions.
2. Check if the colors are easy to see.

**Main Text**

1. Check: to make it easy to read, in every paragraph, first and last sentences are important. Usually, first sentence introduces and summarizes the whole paragraph you want to describe; last sentence concludes the whole paragraph (e.g. "This result suggests that ...").
2. In Results, be more subjectively, such as "We analyzed the data ..."; not "The data were analyzed …".
3. In Methods, we may use passive sentence sometimes , such as " The difference was tested by paired t test.".

 

**Statistics**

1. Check  every result to see if it needs statistical test: Was a test used? Which one? What is the *P*-value?
2. Check  every enrichment to see if it was statistically determined to be enriched:  What test was used? Which one? What is the *P*-value?
